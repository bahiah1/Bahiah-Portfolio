    <h4>Elementary School Friends</h4>

    <h4>Secondary School Friends</h4>
    <p>These are my friends from secondary school. In the picture, from left to right, are my friends Adlina, Nureen, me, and Najihah. We were tablemates when I was 16 and 17 years old, as we were placed in the same class. They were the ones I spent most of my school days with, sharing laughter, supporting one another, and working together through academic challenges. Our bond grew stronger through study sessions, group projects, and the everyday moments that made our school years so memorable.</p>

    <h4>Secondary School Friends</h4>
    <p>These are my other close friends from secondary school. In the picture, from left to right, are Awfa, me, Farah, Irsya, and Aisya. Even though we were in different classes and even attended different schools, we always made time to hang out and stay connected. They were a big part of my school life. We shared countless memories, supported each other through tough times, and laughed our way through the ups and downs of teenage life. Our friendship remained strong despite the differences in our daily routines, and I truly cherish the bond we built together.</p>

    <h4>University Friends</h4>
    <p>These are my friends from university. In the picture, from left to right, are my friends Tasa, Me, Allys, and Awin.We met during our studies and have been close ever since. Whether it's grabbing lunch after class, stressing over assignments together, or just hanging out in between lectures, we've created so many fun memories.

    <h4>Online Friends</h4>
    <p>These are some amazing friends I’ve met online. Even though we've never met in person, we've shared so many moments through games, chats, and calls. I always play with them every night when I have free time. It’s something I really look forward to after a long day. We support each other just like real-life friends, and our connection is just as strong. From helping with school work to cheering each other up after a rough day, they’ve become a special part of my daily life. I'm truly thankful for the bond we’ve built through screens.</p>
