  <h3>Welcome to My Family Page</h3>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Bahiah, and I’d like to introduce you to my amazing family.
    We live in a small town in Kelantan and enjoy spending time together, whether it's during meals, holidays, or weekend outings.
    Each of us has a unique personality, and we always support one another, no matter what.
  </p>

    <h4>My Parents</h4>
    <p>My father's name is Zaykarnain Bin Hassan. This August, he'll be turning 53 years old. 
    <br><br>
    He works as a technician at TMB, where he helps maintain and repair important systems and equipment. He is very skilled at his job and always gives his best. 
    <br><br>
    In his free time, he enjoys watching action movies or dramas, and his hobbies often change, but currently, he enjoys participating in small slingshot competitions.
    <br><br>
    I really admire his adventurous spirit and how he always tries new things with passion.</p>

    <p>My mother's name is Roslina Binti Hamid. She is 44 years old.
    <br><br>
    She is a full-time housewife who takes great care of our home and our family. She loves cooking new recipes, watching a variety of genres of dramas, and keeping the house warm and welcoming.
    <br><br> 
    I admire her kindness and how she always puts our family first, no matter how busy she is.</p>

    <h4>My Siblings</h4>
    <p>I have five siblings who make our family lively and fun. I have one sister, two younger brothers, and one younger sister. Each of them has their unique personality and interests.</p> 
    <p>Firstly, my sister Nur Batrisyia is three years older than me and is currently 23 years old. She is studying for a degree in Telecommunication Engineering at UniKL in Selangor. Because of our small age gap, she is my closest sibling, and we even share the same room. She has loved playing volleyball since elementary school and continues to enjoy it passionately.
    <br><br>
   Next is my younger brother, Muhammad Baihaqi, who is the third sibling in our family. He is 17 years old and currently in secondary school at SMK Tanah Merah 1 in Kelantan. This year, he will be sitting for his important national exams, the SPM. He enjoys playing football and often participates in competitions, both at school and between towns.
    <br><br>
    Then comes my fourth sibling, Muhammad Badrul Amin. He is 13 years old and attends the same school as his older brother. He is the most helpful and hardworking among us, always willing to lend a hand. He loves riding bicycles with his friends around our neighborhood and, in his free time, enjoys playing games with my younger sister.
    <br><br>
    Last but not least is my youngest sibling, Nur Balqis Afeeya. She is 5 years old and is the most pampered by our parents. She was born in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, so she didn’t have many opportunities to enjoy her early childhood with friends her age due to quarantine restrictions. However, now she has made many friends and enjoys spending time with them. Her hobbies include playing games with my younger brother and pretending to do makeup. She loves it so much that she often buys makeup toys.</p>
    <p>My family means everything to me. Each member plays an important role in my life, and I’m grateful for the love, support, and laughter we share every day. No matter how different our personalities or interests are, we always stand by each other. I hope this short introduction helped you get to know the amazing people I’m lucky to call my family.</p>
